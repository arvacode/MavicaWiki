# FAQ

This page addresses some common issues faced by users.

## 1. Why are the new batteries such a tight fit? How can they be removed if stuck?

Aftermarket batteries, often purchased from sites like eBay or Amazon, tend to be slightly larger than the original Sony batteries. Unfortunately, the official batteries have degraded due to age, leaving aftermarket options as the primary choice.

To remove stuck batteries, **"heavy-duty" velcro** is an effective solution. Additionally, using a thin, flat piece of ribbon wrapped around the battery can make removal easier. Ensure the ribbon is gripped securely and tucked behind the battery door when closed, though this step is optional. Care must be taken not to cover any electrical contacts, as this can prevent the camera from powering onâ€”a problem that is easily diagnosed.

Another option is the **[550 Battery Puller](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavica/comments/191ekru/introducing_the_550_battery_puller/)**, designed specifically to address this issue.

## 2. Why can't pictures from the camera be read on a USB floppy drive, even though the Mavica reads them without issue?

This issue is often caused by a **head alignment problem** with the Mavica's floppy drive. Some users have reported success by disassembling and reassembling the drive, with adjustments to the motor potentially playing a role. Following a disassembly guide or video for the specific camera model can help access and work on the drive.

If repair sounds too complicated, Mavica cameras are relatively inexpensive in the U.S., making it feasible to swap parts between cameras to create a functioning unit.

When testing drives, it is helpful to use a floppy disk written on a different drive. A misaligned drive can read and write its own disks but struggle with disks created on another device. A functioning drive should be able to read disks from other sources. In some cases, the issue may lie with the disks themselves, so testing with multiple disks is recommended.

## 3. What is the difference between the "field" and "frame" modes on the camera?

The **"frame" mode** records a higher-quality image compared to the **"field" mode**. These terms are derived from interlaced video technology, as early Digital Mavica models were built around camcorder image sensors.

- **Field Mode**: Records a single portion of a full frame. It is better suited for fast-moving subjects or handling camera shake, as it eliminates the risk of movement between fields.
- **Frame Mode**: Records two fields in rapid succession and combines them into a full image. This mode works best with still subjects and minimal camera shake.

The difference in quality between the modes is subtle, and by modern standards, both produce low-quality images. However, this is often considered part of the charm of using a Mavica. For most situations, frame mode is recommended for better image quality.
